# â˜• Bash - Java Starting Point

## Problem Description

We got "rm -rf"-ed a lot of times. We don't want to spend our precious time creating a new fresh project every time manually. This simple Bash script will help you to do that.

## Requirements

1. UNIX-like system only (sorry Windows users).
2. [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)
3. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/)
4. [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
5. [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## How to Run the Script

1. Clone this repository to your desired location

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/rgxcp/java-starting-point.git
   ```

2. Change directory into the project.

   ```bash
   $ cd java-starting-point
   ```

3. Run the following command.

   ```bash
   $ ./jsp.sh TheNameOfYourProjectInCapital /path/to/copy/this/project
   ```

4. Open the new freshly generated project using Intellij IDEA.
